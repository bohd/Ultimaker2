Ultimaker2 tweak by Bohd
==========

In this repository you will find improved designs for Ultimaker 2, maily for machined metal parts. BOHD implements Design for Manufacturing and Assembly to lower down maching cost and assembly cost.

Also 2D drawings are refined, including adding dimensional and geometric tolerances, material standards, finishing and workmanship requirements. The drawings follow ASME standards but major dimensions use dual (impreial and metric) dimension.

BOHD is the abbreviation of Bohd Open Hardware Distribution, founded in May 2014 and locates in Boston, Massachusetts.

Cuurently we are working on the following parts:
